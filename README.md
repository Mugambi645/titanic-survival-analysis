<h4>The Challenge</h4>
<p>
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, i'll try to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

</p>
<p>I have used accuracy_score to evaluate this binary classification problem</p>
         
Accuracy = TP + TN / TP + TN + FP + FN

where TP = True Positives,
TN = True Negatives,
FP = False Positives,
FN = False Negatives
<p>Consider checking the confusion matrix for further details</p>
<p>You can view predictions as binary outcomes i.e 1/0 in submission.csv file</p>
